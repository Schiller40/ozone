# Notes for sample presentations

These are some sample presentation with correct syntax as of message spec_version 0.0.2 (see `../message.md`). The folder name equals the id of the presentation - not any kind of name or similar. The presentations are meant to help check the code: whether it renders properly and is interpreted properly by the editor.

For now, 07... is used for testing various image files (formats as well as aspect ratios), 3f... is used for testing video files and 6f... us used for testing iframed websites (local and websites from another origin), 42... is used for testing simple text messages.

This testing is necessary to reduce edge case scenarios. If there are missing mime types, please add them.
