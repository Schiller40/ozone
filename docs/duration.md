# Duration
Duration is a String that gets parsed by the `parse-duration` module.
[NPM - parse-duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-duration)

## example
`duration: "1h"` displays the slide for 1 hour

`duration: "15min"` duration is 14 minutes

durations can be combined as such:

`duration: "1h 15min"`
where the units are seperated by spaced. The units follow the Number without any spaces
